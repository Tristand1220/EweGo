## Issue Resolution Log

### Problem: Incorrect Voltage Readings
**Date**: 2026-01-05

**Symptom**:
- Battery voltage reading showed **0.8V** during operation
- Device was running on battery power (impossible at 0.8V for Li-Ion)
- Expected voltage range: 3.0V - 4.2V for Li+ batteries

**Root Cause**:
Incorrect voltage calculation in `max17048_test.py:81`

**Original Code**:
```python
# VCELL register: 12-bit value, LSB = 78.125 µV
voltage = (raw >> 4) * 0.000078125 * 4  # Result in volts
```

**Issue**:
- Multiplication factor was **4** instead of **16**
- This caused voltage readings to be **4× too low**
- The LSB is actually **1.25mV** (not 78.125µV)
- Calculation: 78.125µV × 16 = 1.25mV

**Fix Applied**:
```python
# VCELL register: 12-bit value, LSB = 1.25 mV
voltage = (raw >> 4) * 0.00125  # Result in volts
```

**Result**:
- Before fix: 0.8V (incorrect)
- After fix: 3.534V (correct)
- Voltage now accurately reflects Li-Ion battery state

## Testing Results

### Initial Testing (Before Fix)
```
Battery Voltage: 0.848V  ✗ (4× too low)
State of Charge: 0.00%
```

### After Voltage Fix
```
Battery Voltage: 3.534V  ✓ (correct)
State of Charge: 1.00%   ✓ (battery was nearly depleted)
IC Version: 0x0000
Config Register: 0x9797
Alert Threshold: 9%
Alert Status: Inactive
```

### Continuous Monitoring (2 minutes)
- Voltage: Stable at 3.534V
- SOC: Stable at 1.00% (early stage of recharge)
- No errors or communication issues
- Consistent readings every 5 seconds

## Technical Details

### MAX17048 Register Map
| Register | Address | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| VCELL | 0x02 | Battery voltage (12-bit, 1.25mV/LSB) |
| SOC | 0x04 | State of charge (MSB: integer %, LSB: 1/256%) |
| MODE | 0x06 | Mode control register |
| VERSION | 0x08 | IC version number |
| CONFIG | 0x0C | Configuration and alert settings |
| COMMAND | 0xFE | Command register (reset, etc.) |

### Commands
- **Quick-Start**: `0x4000` - Restart fuel gauge calculations
- **Reset**: `0x5400` - Full device reset

### Voltage Calculation
```python
raw_value = (MSB << 8) | LSB          # Read 16-bit register
vcell_12bit = raw_value >> 4           # Extract bits [15:4]
voltage_v = vcell_12bit * 0.00125      # Convert to volts (1.25mV LSB)
```

### SOC Calculation
```python
raw_value = (MSB << 8) | LSB           # Read 16-bit register
soc_percent = (raw_value >> 8) + (raw_value & 0xFF) / 256.0
```

## Battery State Interpretation

### Voltage vs SOC Guide (Typical Li-Ion)
| Voltage | Approximate SOC | Battery State |
|---------|-----------------|---------------|
| 4.20V | 100% | Fully charged |
| 4.00V | 85-90% | High |
| 3.80V | 60-70% | Medium-high |
| 3.70V | 40-50% | Medium (nominal) |
| 3.50V | 10-20% | Low |
| 3.30V | 0-5% | Very low |
| 3.00V | 0% | Discharged (cutoff) |

**Note**: The MAX17048 fuel gauge tracks actual charge flow, so SOC readings may differ from voltage-based estimates, especially:
- During charging (voltage rises faster than SOC)
- After deep discharge (requires recalibration)
- With battery age/degradation

## Quick Start Guide

### 1. Enable I2C (if not already enabled)
```bash
sudo raspi-config
# Navigate to: Interface Options -> I2C -> Enable
# Reboot if prompted
```

### 2. Detect MAX17048
After reboot, run the detection script:
```bash
python3 detect_max17048.py
```
This will scan all I2C buses and tell you which one has the MAX17048.

### 3. Run Tests
Once detected, run the test script with the correct bus number:
```bash
# For this hardware configuration (bus 3):
python3 max17048_test.py --bus 3
```

---

## Usage Notes

1. **I2C Bus Selection**: Always specify `--bus 3` for this hardware configuration
2. **Quick-Start**: Run after battery replacement or if SOC seems inaccurate
3. **Alert Threshold**: Default is 9%, can be set between 1-32%
4. **Monitoring**: Use continuous monitoring to observe charging/discharging trends
5. **SOC Accuracy**: Fuel gauge learns battery characteristics over charge/discharge cycles

---

## Troubleshooting

### Device Not Found
1. Run `detect_max17048.py` to locate the device
2. Check I2C wiring (SDA/SCL on GPIO pins 2/3)
3. Verify power supply to MAX17048
4. Check for proper I2C pull-up resistors (4.7kΩ typical)
5. Scan I2C bus manually: `i2cdetect -y 3`

### SOC Shows 0% Despite Good Voltage
1. Run Quick-Start test (option 4) to recalibrate
2. Allow time for fuel gauge to stabilize (1-2 seconds)
3. Battery may genuinely be depleted despite voltage recovery during charging

### Remote I/O Errors
1. Check I2C bus number is correct (use bus 3)
2. Verify device is powered and responding
3. Check for I2C bus conflicts or electrical issues
4. Try device reset (option 6)

### Permission Denied
```bash
# Run with sudo or add user to i2c group
sudo python3 max17048_test.py --bus 3

# Or add user to i2c group (logout/login required)
sudo usermod -a -G i2c $USER
```
